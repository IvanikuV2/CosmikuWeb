# CosmikuWeb

This is the website for [Cosmiku](https://cosmiku.net). Licensed under GPLv3, for now it's a really light and simple raw HTML frontend under Nginx. Soon it will work under an actual framework, feel free to contribute!

**One day later update: Work is being done to transition this to Nuxt, [check the new nuxt branch](https://github.com/IvanikuV2/CosmikuWeb/tree/nuxt)**
